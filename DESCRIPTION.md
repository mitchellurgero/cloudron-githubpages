This app packages GitHub Pages version <upstream>177</upstream>.

GitHub Pages is a Cloudron app for hosting static web pages for GitHub users, user blogs, project documentation or even whole books.

It is integrated with the Jekyll software for static web site and blog generation. The Jekyll source pages for a web site can be stored as a Git repository inside the app, and when the repository is updated the GitHub Pages servers will automatically regenerate the site.
